# Python Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my Python programming portfolio!

## Featured Project
- **Healthcare Data Manipulation** - Developed Python workflow that extracts synthetic healthcare data from SQL Server and Snowflake, validates and transforms data using pandas, performs exploratory analysis, and exports processed dataset for downstream use. Demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, SQL querying, database connectivity (SQLAlchemy, pyodbc), environment management, data cleaning and validation, pandas-based transformation, exploratory data analysis (matplotlib/seaborn), joining and enriching datasets, workflow organization, and exporting structured outputs.
