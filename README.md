# Python Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my Python programming portfolio! This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end data engineering and analytics skills in Python, including extracting data from relational and cloud data warehouses, cleaning and transforming real-world datasets, integrating multiple data sources, and applying statistical modeling and visualization to answer applied policy and operational questions in healthcare and education.

## Featured Projects
- **Healthcare Data Manipulation** - Extracts synthetic healthcare claims and diagnosis data from SQL Server and Snowflake, joins and cleans the datasets, and performs common analytic transformations such as summarization, filtering, sorting, and feature creation using pandas and NumPy.
- **California High School Analysis** - Integrates California School Dashboard datasets and uses weighted linear regression to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and academic performance in math and ELA among high schools, producing predictions, residuals, visualizations, and an output file for further analysis.
