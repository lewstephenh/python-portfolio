# Python Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my Python programming portfolio!

## Featured Project
- **Healthcare Data Manipulation** - Developed Python workflow that extracts synthetic healthcare data from SQL Server and Snowflake, validates and transforms data using pandas, performs exploratory analysis, and exports processed dataset for downstream use. Demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, SQL querying, database connectivity (SQLAlchemy, pyodbc), environment management, data cleaning and validation, pandas-based transformation, exploratory data analysis (matplotlib/seaborn), joining and enriching datasets, workflow organization, and exporting structured outputs. 
- **Medicare Claims Analysis** - Conducted an end-to-end quantitative analysis of Medicare beneficiary and claims data using Python, including data cleaning, validation, payment calculations, descriptive analyses, and multivariable regression to examine drivers of Medicare spending. Demonstrates Medicare claims and beneficiary data structure; health care payment components (Medicare, beneficiary responsibility, primary payer); quantitative health services research methods; data cleaning, merging, and validation; large-dataset analysis using Python (pandas, NumPy); statistical modeling (OLS regression with statsmodels); exploratory data analysis and visualization; creation of publication-ready tables and figures; technical documentation of methods and limitations; attention to data quality and analytic rigor.
