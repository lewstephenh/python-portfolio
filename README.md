# Python Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my Python programming portfolio! This repository showcases Python projects that demonstrate my skills in data extraction (from SQL Server and Snowflake), data manipulation, data merging, functions, and statistical analysis. I use the following libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and SQLAlchemy.

## Featured Projects
- **Healthcare Data Manipulation** - Data extraction (SQL Server and Snowflake), joins, variable creation, aggregation
- **California High School Analysis** - Linear regression
