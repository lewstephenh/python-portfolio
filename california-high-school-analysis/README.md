## Description
Built a reproducible Python pipeline to analyze California School Dashboard data, integrating enrollment, assessment, and graduation datasets at the school level. Performed data cleaning, aggregation, and feature engineering with pandas and NumPy. Estimated enrollment-weighted linear regression models (scikit-learn) to quantify the relationship between the percentage of socioeconomically disadvantaged students and distance from standard in Math and ELA. Generated fitted values, residuals, and diagnostic visualizations using Matplotlib, and exported a consolidated analytic dataset for downstream analysis.

## Usage
To execute the Python program, follow these steps:
1. Open JupyterLab.
2. Load the Jupyter notebook `regression_analysis.ipynb`
3. Edit the last cell so that the data is exported to the desired location.
4. Run all cells.
